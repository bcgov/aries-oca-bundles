The publishing process includes a lightweight governance process for ensuring those contributing to the repository are the \"authority\" over the OCA Bundles they submit/update, and that what they submit is, in fact, a valid OCA Bundle for a published Hyperledger AnonCreds Schema and/or Credential Definition. Once published, Aries agents following the OCA for Aries RFC guidance have an easy to implement process for finding, retrieving and using OCA Bundles for credentials that they need to display.</p> <p>The OCA Bundles should follow the rules for OCA for Aries RFC OCA Bundles, including the OCA for Aries Style Guide RFC. Each OCA Bundle must be accompanied by some metadata about the credential, such as on what ledger the credential schema and/or credential definition (CredDef) reside, and may be accompanied by the full OCA Source data--Excel and JSON files.  There are tools in the associated GitHub repository for converting OCA Source to the Bundle to make it easier for contributors.</p> <p>Currently, the repository assumes that the OCA Bundles are for Hyperledger AnonCreds Verifiable Credentials. We expect that other formats, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Standard JSON-LD credentials will eventually also be supported.</p> <p>To see all of the OCA for Aries Bundles that have been published in this repository, use either the OCA Bundles tab, or the OCA Explorer tab. The OCA Bundles tab contains a page about each bundle in the repository, while the OCA Explorer tab provides a tool for experimenting with the branding of an OCA Bundle. Use the drop down to see/experiment with all the OCA Bundles in the registry, or upload your own OCA Bundle in the OCA Explorer to see how it will look.</p>"},{"location":"#contributing-an-oca-bundle","title":"Contributing an OCA Bundle","text":"<p>For information about contributing an OCA Bundle into the registry, please see the information in

OCA Bundles are used by mobile wallets, such as those built on the OpenWallet Foundation's Bifold Wallet.</p> <p></p> <p>Creating an OCA Bundle from scratch consists of a two parts.</p> <ul> <li>Creating the information needed to create the OCA Bundle for submitting a GitHub Issue in the Aries OCA Bundles repository to have the OCA Bundle created. This is usually handled by an Issuer team member, often a designer, collaborating with translation experts. This part is covered in this document.</li> <li>The (quite technical) process of submitting a GitHub Pull Request (PR) to publish the OCA Bundle and make it available to Wallets. Since the process is quite technical, feel free to stop at the \"Create Issue\" part, and we (the maintainers of the Aries OCA Bundles repo) will take it from there -- getting an approval from the Issuer team along the way. The instructions for the second part are in the Create the OCA Bundle PR document.</li> </ul> <p>So, to get as far as creating a GitHub Issue, here's a summary of what you are going to do:</p> <ul> <li>Create the OCA Bundle source data using Excel, the OCA Explorer site and a text editor, including identifying the logo, images and other branding data.</li> <li>Gather the identifiers (schemaId or credDefId) for the credential to which the bundle applies.</li> <li>Define where in the Aries OCA Bundles repository the OCA Bundle should be placed.</li> <li>Create a GitHub Issue in the Aries OCA Bundles repository, attaching the files and information about the new OCA Bundle.</li> </ul> <p>We'll cover each steps in the following sections.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/OCABundleCreation/#collect-the-oca-bundle-source-data","title":"Collect the OCA Bundle Source Data","text":"<p>To get started, you (the Issuer) will need to collect some basic information about the credential for which you are building an OCA Bundle. If you are not familiar with how you can control the display of a credential using an OCA Bundle, please take a look at the result of applying OCA Bundles to existing credentials, by going to the OCA Explorer tab of this website. There, you can select and review the existing credentials, and see how others have used OCA for their credentials. You should also review the OCA for Aries Style Guide. It has the details about what you can control in displaying your credential, and Do's and Don'ts as you create your bundle.</p> <p>Once you have an idea of what you are going to be doing, you need to gather some data:</p> <ul> <li>The list of attributes and their data types in the credential. That will usually come from the technical team creating the credential issuer software. The attribute names must match exactly what is in the schema for the credential type.</li> <li>The images that you want to use in displaying your credential -- a logo, background image and a background image slice. Guidelines for, and how the images will be used, are below.</li> <li>The colours (or colors) you want to use for the credential -- a primary and secondary, in RGB hex format.</li> </ul> <p>You will (later) use the OCA Explorer to experiment with your images and colours as you adjust them to be just right.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In most cases, you only create one OCA Bundle for a credential that your organization Issues, and use it for the Dev, Test and Production sites. Often, a watermark is added to differentiate a \"Test\" credential from a production one -- the addition of the watermark is covered in the later creating the PR part of the process. However, you want to have different OCA Bundles for Dev/Test and Production beyond the just the watermark difference. If you do, please create multiple OCA Bundles, identifying the target environment for each. It adds management overhead, but that's all. It's up to you.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/OCABundleCreation/#create-the-oca-excel-file","title":"Create the OCA Excel File","text":"<p>Next up is to populate an Excel spreadsheet with the core and language-specific information about your credential type.

Here is a quick summary of the process, thoroughly documented in the Excel file (<code>Documentation</code> tab):</p> <ul> <li>On the \"Main\" tab, enter a list of the attributes, their data types, and a flag indicating if an attribute is Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</li> <li>On the language tabs (\"en\" and \"fr\"), add in language-specific data about the Credential (name, description, Issuer, etc.), and a label and description about each pre-populated credential attribute.
